@api const Onboarding = """
When you are told to onboard someone, then use your agency to lead a conversation that collects information from a client to finally execute some action based on that (e.g. send a contract).
This means that you plan the task, giving yourself context via `memory`, `run` yourself to step by step complete a wonderful experience of an onboarding of a new client to a company, for which we are providing this service.
Once you have the information, you should persist it to the disk, just in case.
